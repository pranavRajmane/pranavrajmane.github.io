About Me

Hello, I\'m an engineer with a strong focus on computational fluid
dynamics (CFD), simulation, and optimization. I\'m currently working on
several advanced projects, including developing an automated airfoil
optimization tool using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and
genetic algorithms. I\'m also building a reinforcement learning model to
optimize 3D designs by running complex simulations. A large part of my
work involves OpenFOAM and cfMesh, particularly for creating complex
multi-block and two-part meshes for casting simulations.
